Reoccurring & Repeatable Reservations
=====================================
> Any reservation should be repeatable.

This should be plugged into the conflict workflow and repeating reservations
should be stored in as compact a way as possible. They should have rules and
exceptions dates, when exceptions occur a
standalone reservation can be created that is still part of the repeating set of
reservations. This also means that it would be possible, although not compact,
to have repeating reservations regular reservations with a searchable identifier
that allows them to be updated as a set.
