reserve
=======

Reserving things is difficult. Every system out there appears to be specialized
to reserve certain types of things, like hotel rooms, lab equipment, meeting
spaces, or resources. Many of these systems have awesome features, but they're
specific to the system. Equipment reservation systems have lab hours, but
sometimes you want to have studios that are more like hotel rooms than a camera.
Systems that add that functionality cost substantially more than systems which
don't have that hotel like interface.

Even though these expensive systems handle the extra requirements, many of them
are clunky and an eyesore to look at. The cheaper ones can be just as much of an
eyesore. Additionally, these systems require special hardware or OS
requirements, many of them that I've found only run on windows.
