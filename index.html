      <h1>Reserve API</h1>
      <blockquote>Reserving things is difficult. It shouldn't be.</blockquote>
      <p>Every system out there appears to be specialized
        to reserve certain types of things, like hotel rooms, lab equipment, meeting
        spaces, or resources. Many of these systems have awesome features, but they're
        specific to the system. Equipment reservation systems have lab hours, but
        sometimes you want to have studios that are more like hotel rooms than a camera.
        Systems that add that functionality cost substantially more than systems which
        don't have that hotel like interface.</p>
      <p>Even though these expensive systems handle the extra requirements, many of them
        are clunky and an eyesore to look at. The cheaper ones can be just as much of an
        eyesore and they lack features. Additionally, these systems require special hardware or OS
        requirements, many of them that I've found only run on windows. This adds costs,
        makes it harder for smaller organizations to get started, and adds other costs
        like licensing. It's time for some change. It's time to build something we can
        throw on any hardware and scale it up later when we need to. We need a platform
        that we can use to reserve things. Not to reserve hotel rooms or lab equipment,
        just things.
      </p>
      <p>We should be able to plug this system into other systems that exist out there,
        like Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, Symfony, and eventually Rails, Django, .NET and other non
        PHP systems. An eventual goal of this project would to make a pure C
        implementation of the reserve API, which enables its usage with any language
        that supports C bindings (similar to <a href="http://libgit2.github.com/" target="_blank" title="libgit2">libgit2</a>).
